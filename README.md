For example:
```
cd C:\users\user\downloads\Screen-Ruler\
```
 - Then you have to open it by typing
```
python main.py
```

Once you have started the application some parameters will be asked. You should just leave "auto" checked and click confirm.

Now all you have to do is measure. You can double click to delete all triangles.
You can precisely move the cursor by 1 pixel with the arrow keys and click with the enter key.

Make sure that all measurements match up with a physical ruler, if all measurements are good, you can leave it in auto.
If they are not correct, you will have to uncheck auto and enter the screen parameters manually yourself.

There is a high chance that once you start the program a warning about accuracy appears, you should not worry about it, as the inacuraccy is insignificant.

You can press P to convert the program into an overlay, so you can use your computer as normal with the triangles on top.
To go back to the ruler you have to click on it on the task bar (or with alt+tab), then press P again.

To exit the program you have to press alt+F4 while it is __not an overlay__.
